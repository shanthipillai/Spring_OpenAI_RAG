Budget 2024-2025
Speech of
Nirmala Sitharaman
Minister of Finance
July 23, 2024
Hon’ble Speaker,
I present the Budget for 2024-25.
Introduction
1.
The people of India have reposed their faith in the government led by
the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and re-elected it for a historic
third term under his leadership. We are grateful for their support, faith and
trust in our policies. We are determined to ensure that all Indians, regardless
of religion, caste, gender and age, make substantial progress in realising their
life goals and aspirations.
Global Context
2.
The global economy, while performing better than expected, is still in
the grip of policy uncertainties. Elevated asset prices, political uncertainties
and shipping disruptions continue to pose significant downside risks for
growth and upside risks to inflation.
3.
In this context, India’s economic growth continues to be the shining
exception and will remain so in the years ahead. India’s inflation continues to
be low, stable and moving towards the 4 per cent target. Core inflation (non-
food, non-fuel) currently is 3.1 per cent. Steps are being taken to ensure
supplies of perishable goods reach market adequately.

2
Interim Budget
4.
As mentioned in the interim budget, we need to focus on 4 major
castes, namely ‘Garib’ (Poor),
‘Mahilayen’
(Women),
‘Yuva’ (Youth) and
‘Annadata’ (Farmer). For Annadata, we announced higher Minimum Support
Prices a month ago for all major crops, delivering on the promise of at least a
50 per cent margin over costs. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana was
extended for five years, benefitting more than 80 crore people.
5.
Administrative actions for approval and implementation of various
schemes announced in the interim budget are well underway. The required
allocations have been made.
Budget Theme
6.
Turning attention to the full year and beyond, in this budget, we
particularly focus on employment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class. I am
happy to announce the Prime Minister’s package of 5 schemes and initiatives
to facilitate employment, skilling and other opportunities for 4.1 crore youth
over a 5-year period with a central outlay of ` 2 lakh crore. I will speak about
them shortly, while more details may be seen in the annexure. This year, I
have made a provision of ` 1.48 lakh crore for education, employment and
skilling.
Budget Priorities
7.
The people have given a unique opportunity to our government to
take the country on the path of strong development and all-round prosperity.
In the interim budget, we promised to present a detailed roadmap for our
pursuit of ‘Viksit Bharat’. In line with the strategy set out in the interim
budget, this budget envisages sustained efforts on the following 9 priorities
for generating ample opportunities for all.
1) Productivity and resilience in Agriculture
2) Employment & Skilling
3) Inclusive Human Resource Development and Social Justice
4) Manufacturing & Services
5) Urban Development
6) Energy Security
7) Infrastructure

3
8) Innovation, Research & Development and
9) Next Generation Reforms
8.
Subsequent budgets will build on these, and add more priorities and
actions. A more detailed formulation will be carried out as part of the
‘economic policy framework’ about which I will speak later in this speech.
9.
This budget details some of the specific actions to be initiated in the
current year towards fulfilment of these priorities with potential for
transformative changes.
The budget also covers some of the previously
made announcements with an intent to strengthen them and step up their
implementation for expediting our journey towards the goal of Viksit Bharat.
Priority 1: Productivity and resilience in Agriculture
Transforming agriculture research
10. Our government will undertake a comprehensive review of the
agriculture research setup to bring the focus on raising productivity and
developing climate resilient varieties. Funding will be provided in challenge
mode,
including to the private sector. Domain experts both from the
government and outside will oversee the conduct of such research.
Release of new varieties
11. New 109 high-yielding and climate-resilient varieties of 32 field and
horticulture crops will be released for cultivation by farmers.
Natural Farming
12.
In the next two years, 1 crore farmers across the country will be
initiated into natural farming supported by certification and branding.
Implementation will be through scientific institutions and willing gram
panchayats. 10,000 need-based bio-input resource centres will be
established.
Missions for pulses and oilseeds
13.
For achieving
self-sufficiency in
pulses
and oilseeds, we will
strengthen their production, storage and marketing. As announced in the
interim budget, a strategy is being put in place to achieve ‘atmanirbharta’ for
oil seeds such as mustard, groundnut, sesame, soybean, and sunflower.

4
Vegetable production & Supply Chains
14.
Large scale clusters for vegetable production will be developed closer
to major consumption
centres. We will promote Farmer-Producer
Organizations,
cooperatives and start-ups for vegetable supply chains
including for collection, storage, and marketing.
Digital Public Infrastructure for Agriculture
15.
Buoyed by the success of the pilot project, our government,
in
partnership with the states, will facilitate the implementation of the Digital
Public Infrastructure (DPI) in agriculture for coverage of farmers and their
lands in 3 years. During this year, digital crop survey for Kharif using the DPI
will be taken up in 400 districts. The details of 6 crore farmers and their lands
will be brought into the farmer and land registries. Further, the issuance of
Jan Samarth based Kisan Credit Cards will be enabled in 5 states.
Shrimp Production & Export
16.
Financial support for setting up a network of Nucleus Breeding
Centres for Shrimp Broodstocks will be provided. Financing for shrimp
farming, processing and export will be facilitated through NABARD.
National Cooperation Policy
17. Our government will bring out a National Cooperation Policy for
systematic, orderly and all-round development of the cooperative sector.
Fast-tracking growth of rural economy and generation of employment
opportunities on a large scale will be the policy goal.
18.
This year, I have made a provision of ` 1.52 lakh crore for agriculture
and allied sector.
Priority 2: Employment & Skilling
Employment Linked Incentive
19. Our government will implement following 3 schemes for ‘Employment
Linked Incentive’, as part of the Prime Minister’s package. These will be
based on enrolment in the EPFO, and focus on recognition of
first-time
employees, and support to employees and employers.

5
Scheme A: First Timers
20.
This scheme will provide one-month wage to all persons newly
entering the workforce in all formal sectors. The direct benefit transfer of
one-month salary in 3 instalments to first-time employees, as registered in
the EPFO, will be up to ` 15,000. The eligibility limit will be a salary of
` 1 lakh per month. The scheme is expected to benefit 210 lakh youth.
Scheme B: Job Creation in manufacturing
21.
This scheme will incentivize additional employment in the
manufacturing sector, linked to the employment of first-time employees. An
incentive will be provided at specified scale directly both to the employee
and the employer with respect to their EPFO contribution in the first 4 years
of employment. The scheme is expected to benefit 30 lakh youth entering
employment, and their employers.
Scheme C: Support to employers
22.
This employer-focussed scheme will cover additional employment in
all sectors. All additional employment within a salary of ` 1 lakh per month
will be counted. The government will reimburse to employers up to ` 3,000
per month for 2 years towards their EPFO contribution for each additional
employee. The scheme is expected to incentivize additional employment of
50 lakh persons.
Participation of women in the workforce
23. We will facilitate higher participation of women in the workforce
through setting up of working women hostels in collaboration with industry,
and establishing creches. In addition, the partnership will seek to organize
women-specific skilling programmes, and promotion of market access for
women SHG enterprises.
Skilling programme
24.
I am happy to announce a new centrally sponsored scheme, as the 4th
scheme under the Prime Minister’s package, for skilling in collaboration with
state governments and Industry. 20 lakh youth will be skilled over a 5-year
period. 1,000 Industrial Training Institutes will be upgraded in hub and spoke
arrangements with outcome orientation. Course content and design will be

6
aligned to the skill needs of industry, and new courses will be introduced for
emerging needs.
Skilling Loans
25.
The Model Skill Loan Scheme will be revised to facilitate loans up to
` 7.5 lakh with a guarantee from a government promoted Fund. This measure
is expected to help 25,000 students every year.
Education Loans
26.
For helping our youth who have not been eligible for any benefit
under government schemes and policies, I am happy to announce a financial
support for loans upto ` 10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions.
E-vouchers for this purpose will be given directly to 1 lakh students every
year for annual interest subvention of 3 per cent of the loan amount.
Priority 3: Inclusive Human Resource Development and Social Justice
Saturation approach
27. Our government
is committed to all-round,
all-pervasive and all-
inclusive development of people, particularly, farmers, youth, women and
poor. For achieving social justice comprehensively, the saturation approach
of covering all eligible people through various programmes including those
for education and health will be adopted to empower them by improving
their capabilities.
28.
Implementation of schemes meant for supporting economic activities
by craftsmen, artisans, self-help groups, scheduled caste, schedule tribe and
women entrepreneurs, and street vendors, such as PM Vishwakarma, PM
SVANidhi, National Livelihood Missions, and Stand-Up India will be stepped
up.
Purvodaya
29.
The states in the Eastern part of the country are rich in endowments
and have strong cultural traditions. We will formulate a plan, Purvodaya, for
the all-round development of the eastern region of the country covering
Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. This will cover

7
human resource development, infrastructure, and generation of economic
opportunities to make the region an engine to attain Viksit Bharat.
30. On the Amritsar Kolkata Industrial Corridor, we will support
development of an industrial node at Gaya. This corridor will catalyze
industrial development of the eastern region. The industrial node at Gaya will
also be a good model for developing our ancient centres of cultural
importance into future centres of modern economy. This model shall
showcase “Vikas bhi Virasat bhi” in our growth trajectory.
31. We will also support development of road connectivity projects,
namely (1) Patna-Purnea Expressway, (2) Buxar-Bhagalpur Expressway, (3)
Bodhgaya, Rajgir, Vaishali and Darbhanga spurs, and (4) additional 2-lane
bridge over river Ganga at Buxar at a total cost of ` 26,000 crore. Power
projects, including setting up of a new 2400 MW power plant at Pirpainti, will
be taken up at a cost of ` 21,400 crore. New airports, medical colleges and
sports infrastructure in Bihar will be constructed.
32. An additional allocation to support
capital investments will be
provided. The requests of Bihar Government for external assistance from
multilateral development banks will be expedited.

is proposed to be reduced from ten years to five years. Further,
there are proposals
to rationalise the procedure for
reassessment. Further, it is proposed to omit reference to
Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner in section
275 to provide clarity of time limitation for imposition of
penalties. It is also proposed to withhold refund up to sixty days
of assessment under section 245 and to rationalise time limit to
file appeal to ITAT under section 253.
C.3
Charitable trusts/ Institutions
It is proposed to make amendments to merge the two schemes
for exemption and also provide for rationalisation of filing of
applications and the timelines for registration and approval of
certain benefits to charitable trusts and institutions.
C.4
Simplification of taxation of Capital Gains: The taxation of capital
gains is proposed to be rationalised and simplified.
Short term gains on specified financial assets shall henceforth
attract a tax rate of 20 per cent instead of 15 per cent, while that
on all other financial assets and non-financial assets
shall
continue to attract the applicable tax rate.
Long term gains on all financial and non-financial assets, on the
other hand, will attract a tax rate of 12.5 per cent. For the benefit
of the lower and middle-income classes, it is proposed to increase
the limit of exemption of capital gains on certain listed financial
assets from ₹ 1 lakh to ₹ 1.25 lakh per year.
Listed financial assets held for more than a year will be classified
as long term, while unlisted financial assets and all non-financial
assets will have to be held for at least two years to be classified as
long-term.
Unlisted bonds and debentures, debt mutual funds and market
linked debentures, irrespective of holding period, however, will
attract tax on capital gains at applicable rates.
These proposals are proposed to be given effect with immediate
force.
